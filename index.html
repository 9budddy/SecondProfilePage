            <p>
              Ever since a young age, I always had people around me that needed
              help learning in a differents way. After many years, I've tutored
              many and have helped many others through education, coding, and
              much more.

          <h3>Discord.js</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning discord back in June of 2018. My friend wanted a
            system that limited the amounts of support tickets, and recorded a
            log of the messages within. I was tired of waiting for others to
            come up with things that only worked half of what we wanted, so I
            decided to dive into coding myself and ended up finding my passion.
